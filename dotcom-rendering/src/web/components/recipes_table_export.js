				"Weigh out another 200g of the poached cherries, place in a liquidiser and blitz to a purée (you'll use this in the parfait, too).",
				'To make the parfait, put the sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat and cook until it reaches 120C – this is your stock syrup.',
				'Put the egg yolks in a bowl, pour on the hot syrup, whipping all the time, until the eggs are cold.',
				'Add the cherry purée and mix to blend, then add the marinated cherries and lemon juice.',
				'Carefully fold in the whipped cream and pour the mixture into the chocolate tubes until they are three-quarters full.',
				'Place in the freezer.',
				'To make the mousse, make up some more stock syrup as for the parfait.',
				"Put the egg yolks, 25ml of syrup and 15ml of griottes liquor in a bowl, place over a pan of gently simmering water (make sure the water doesn't touch the base or sides of the bowl) and whisk continuously until the mixture thickens, turns frothy and forms a sabayon.",

				'Tip the flours, yeast, vitamin powder, salt and sugar into a bowl and mix well.',
				'Add 300ml water, and stir in well, then pour in the butter and work in well.',

				'Put 2 chicken carcasses, 2 star anise, 10g ginger, 3 lengths of spring onion, 1 small onion chopped into quarters, 2 cloves garlic in a large pan, add water to cover, bring to a boil, skim, then simmer for 2 hours).',

				'Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil while you get on with making the broth.',
				'In a large saucepan on a medium heat, add 80g oil and the spice paste, and cook, stirring continuously, for 30 minutes, until rich, dark red/brown in colour.',
				'Add all the broth ingredients and the chilli and shrimp soaking liquids, bring to a boil, then simmer gently for 30 minutes.',
				'After 15 minutes, remove the coriander leaves and lemongrass, and adjust the seasoning to taste.',
				'Add the tofu puffs to the broth, so they soak up the flavour, and keep warm.',
				'While the broth is simmering, blanch the following in boiling water one after the other: green beans for three minutes, vermicelli for a minute, beansprouts for 30 seconds.',
				'Refresh them all in cold water to stop them cooking, and drain well.',
				'Portion everything into bowls ready for serving – some vermicelli, then beansprouts, green beans and prawns.',
				'Pour hot broth into each bowl, add four half tofu puffs per serving, garnish with mint and serve.',
				'Combine the sugar, golden syrup and milk in a pan, bring to a boil, then take off the heat and leave to cool a little.',
				'Put the butter, salt and spices in a bowl and pour on the still warm (but not hot) milky syrup.',

				'Roll each piece into a log, then cut it into 3mm slices (or thicker, if you prefer); if you have added nuts to the dough, you will need a really sharp knife to cut it neatly.',
				'Alternatively, to make gingerbread shapes, unwrap the rested dough and divide into workable portions.',
				'Roll out each portion on a very lightly floured work surface (too much flour will make dough dry), then cut it into the desired shapes with a knife or a cookie cutter (I like to make little pigs).',
				'Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6 and line several baking sheets with baking paper.',
				'Arrange the gingerbread shapes on the sheets and bake for no longer than five minutes; keep an eye on them, because they burn very easily.',
				'Remove from the oven and leave to cool on the baking sheets.',
				'Knäck is traditionally poured hot into small paper moulds and left to set.',
				'Mix all the ingredients except the nuts and/or breadcrumbs in a heavy pan (I use a cast-iron skillet or frying pan).',
				'Bring to a simmer on medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon from time to time, and cook until the mix reaches your preferred temperature – 30–40 minutes.',
				'As soon as the toffee is ready, mix in the almonds and/or breadcrumbs, spoon into moulds and leave to set.',

				'Place the sliced lemon in a large saucepan with the cider vinegar, shallot, carrot, bay leaf, herbs and garlic clove.',
				'Add the olive oil, water, ½ tsp of coarsely ground black pepper and 1½ tsp of salt.',
				'Cut the stalks off the artichokes 6-8cm from the base.',
				'Remove the lower leaves until you can feel them becoming more tender – this usually means removing the outer two or three layers, using either your fingers or a small knife.',
				'Using a small sharp knife, peel the tough skin from the stalks, working from the cut end towards the head, as the stalks are edible and I hate to waste good food!',
				'Cut through the heads crossways half-way up and discard the top part.',
				'Trim any hard pieces from the head itself.',
				'Cut in half lengthways.',
				'Carefully cut out the very fine ‘choke’ hairs, or use a small teaspoon to do this.',
				'As each artichoke is ready, add it to the saucepan and stir to coat in the oil and vinegar to prevent it from discolouring.',
				'Once all the artichokes are prepared, add, if needed, just enough water to come to the top of the artichokes.',
				'Lay a paper cartouche on top, pressing it down, and poke a few holes in the paper.',
				'Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle boil and cook until you can easily insert a thick knife through the base and stem of the artichokes, about 12-15 minutes.',
				'Leave to cool in the cooking liquid.',
				'Make the walnut sauce.',
				'Place the walnuts, bread pieces, lemon juice and zest, garlic, iced water and salt in a small food processor (or use a stick or jug blender) and blitz to a puree.',
				'Add the oil and blitz again.',
				'To make the sumac lavosh, preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4.',
				'Place the flours, sugar and salt in a kitchen mixer (a stand mixer rather than a food processor) and mix together.',
				'With the motor running, add 1 tablespoon of oil and the iced water and mix together until a pliable dough is formed.',
				'If it’s too dry, add a little extra iced water; if too wet, add a little extra wholewheat flour.',
				'Mix for 4 minutes on medium-low speed.',
				'Take the dough out, roll it on the work surface into a ball, then wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest for 30 minutes in the fridge.',
				'Pull off walnut-sized pieces and roll out on a floured work surface as thin as you can.',
				'(At my restaurants we run it through our pasta rollers on the second thinnest setting) Lay it on a baking sheet and leave to rest for 20 minutes (this will prevent it shrinking too much when baked).',
				'Bake until golden, turning the tray about 180 degrees after 8 minutes to colour it evenly.',
				'Remove from the oven and brush with the remaining oil and sprinkle with the sumac and some flaky salt while still hot.',
				'Once cooled, store in an airtight container.',
				'To serve, lay the salad leaves on your plates and top with the mozzarella then the artichokes.',
				'Add some of the carrots, lemon slices and shallots from the cooking liquor, then dollop the walnut sauce on top.',
				'Finally, tuck in the sumac lavosh, broken into large shards.',

				'Cover, then refrigerate for 24 hours.',
				'Remove the legs and brush off any salt, pepper and thyme.',
				'Dry the legs with a clean towel, place in an oven dish or pan and add enough duck, goose or pork fat (or a combination) to submerge the legs.',
				'Cover with foil and cook in a medium oven until the flesh is giving but not falling apart – about two hours.',
				'Transfer the meat to a sealable glass, plastic or china container, then pour over the fat to cover.',
				'You can make this confit far in advance, in which case seal the container, leave it to cool, then refrigerate.',
				'Either way, make sure the legs are at room temperature before cooking them further.',
				'Make a stock with rabbit and/or chicken bones and the vegetables.',
				'Meanwhile, make the aïoli.',
				'Put the garlic in the chopping bowl of a food processor with a pinch of salt (this helps to break it up) and pepper, then whizz until finely pulped – this is important, because you do not want garlic chippings in the aïoli.',
				'With the motor running, add the egg yolks, let them meet the garlic for a moment, then slowly add the oil in a gentle stream.',
				'The emulsion should safely hold up to 300ml oil; at that point, take a view and, if you can, add a little more oil.',
				'Add lemon juice, tasting as you go, adjust the seasoning and refrigerate.',
				'Strain the stock into a pan, then bring to a boil and add the shallots.',
				'Cook for 10 minutes, then add the rest of the vegetables except the turnip tops.',
				'Cook for eight minutes, then reduce the broth to a gentle simmer.',
				'Lift the rabbit legs from their fat and use your fingers to scrape off any excess.',
				'Add the legs to the pot and let them gently heat through and soften.',
				'When they are hot and the vegetables are cooked, stir in the turnip greens and wait for them to wilt.',
				'Season to taste, then ladle into deep plates or shallow bowls, so a ladle of broth can be poured over each serving.',

				'Positioning the ball at roughly the middle of the skewer, press around it so that the mince covers all around that part of the skewer.',
				'Now apply a little oil or water to the palm that you have been using for the mince, and gently press the meat in the form of a sausage on the skewer.',
				'The trick is to form a ring between your forefinger and thumb, and use your other fingers to guide the mince; apply a gentle pressure, and push the mince upwards so that the sausage thins itself out over the skewer.',
				'Ideally, the size of the sausage should be around 2.5cm (1 in) or a bit less in diameter.',
				'Heat a griddle pan while you continue to form the mince into sausages on the skewers, until you have 8 skewers.',
				'Cook in the hot griddle pan for approximately 8-10 minutes, rotating the kebabs as they cook.',

				'Stirring a wet caramel encourages these crystals to hook up—and cause clumping.',
				'One common technique for preventing recrystallization is to cook the sugar in a covered pot until the sugar is completely melted; the trapped condensation washes away crystals clinging to the side of the pot.',
				'Another is to use a clean brush dipped in water to wash down the sides, dissolving any crystals that may have formed.',
				'To make a wet caramel, begin by sprinkling the sugar in an even layer in a heavy-bottomed frying pan or saucepan.',
				"Pour water over the sugar until is it completely and evenly moistened—you don't want any dry spots.",
				'Cook the sugar and water over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.',
				'At this point, add a pinch of cream of tartar or a few drops of lemon juice, if indicated or desired.',
				'If it starts to recrystallize, swirl the pan and continue to cook.',
				'Usually, the lumps will melt as the caramel continues to cook.',
				"When the caramel has darkened to the point of being almost burnt — when it's dark amber in colour, smoking, and beginning to gently foam — take it off the heat and stop the cooking by pouring in the liquid called for in the recipe.",
				"Then stir or whisk the caramel over low heat until it's smooth.",
				'If the lumps persist, you can always strain them out.',

				'A skewer should come out clean when the cake is done.',
				'Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.',
				'Then start making the plants using fondant.',
				'You can use plunger cutters to stamp out different sizes of the same-shaped flower, then stack them together and curve the edges upwards to make a succulent shape.',
				'To make the strawberry mushroom, just cut off the stem top of a strawberry and then arrange it on top of a piece of fondant for the mushroom base.',
				'When the cake is cool, use cutters to stamp out pieces of cake, and then use a knife to carve into the cake.',
				'Arrange larger cake pieces and crumbled cake on top of the chilled mousse to create a landscape.',

				'When thickened, pour and scrape into a cold bowl and let it cool, stirring occasionally.',

				'Beat the egg whites until satiny peaks form, then beat in the sugar a spoonful at a time until the meringue is stiff and shiny.',
				'Sprinkle the cornflour over the meringue, then grate in the zest – a fine microplane is best for this – of 1 lemon and add 2 teaspoons of lemon juice.',

				'Put the lemon curd into a bowl and beat it with a wooden spoon or spatula to loosen it a little.',
				'Taste the lemon curd (if it’s shop-bought) and add some lemon zest and a spritz of juice if it’s too sweet.',
				'With a light hand, a glad heart and a spatula, spread the lemon curd on top of the meringue base.',

				'To grate it, coarsely grind the flesh from 1 coconut (around 250g) in a food processor, or use a hand grater.',
				'To make milk, add the flesh from the other coconut to a blender with 800ml of hand-hot water.',
				'Blend for 2 minutes, then strain through a muslin cloth or clean tea towel.',

				' Meanwhile, make the spiced pineapple.',
				'Melt the butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat.',
				'When hot, add the pineapple wedges.',
				'Turn them every 2 minutes, until they start to caramelise and brown.',

				'Weigh the strong and plain white flour in a separate bowl.',
				'When the butter mixture is bubbling, remove it from the heat and add the flour all in one go.',
				'Stir with a wooden spoon until it forms a smooth ball that pulls away from the sides very easily – this is called a panada.',
				'Transfer the panada to a metal stand mixer bowl with paddle attachment.',
				'Leave to cool for 10 minutes or so, or until no longer steaming when mixed on low speed.',
				'Meanwhile, make the craquelin for the choux.',
				'Cream together the butter and sugar.',
				'Add the flour and orange zest.',
				'Combine using a spoon, and then using your hands to form a ball.',
				'Roll out thinly between two sheets of clingfilm and transfer to the freezer.',
				'Add the first egg to the panada, mixing on slow speed.',
				'Whisk the second egg in a separate bowl and add gradually, a tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each addition.',

				'Transfer to a piping bag and cut a medium tip.',
				'Pipe 10 to 12 circles on to the baking tray.',
				'Remove the craquelin from the freezer, and cut similar sized circles and place these on top of each choux bun.',

				'Bake for a further 15 to 20 minutes.',
				'Don’t open the oven until at least 25 minutes have passed, to avoid the choux pastry deflating.',
				'While the choux are baking, make the almond creme mousseline.',
				'Add the milk to a pan and stir over a low to medium heat until just starting to bubble.',
				'In a separate bowl whisk the egg yolks and caster sugar until light and fluffy.',
				'Add the cornflour and mix until just combined.',
				'When the milk is bubbling, pour a small amount (about a third) into the egg yolk mixture, while whisking constantly.',
				'When combined, add the rest of the milk while still continuously whisking.',
				'Then pour it all back into the saucepan.',
				'Put the pan back on a medium heat and whisk by hand until the mixture is very thick.',
				'Then stir in the amaretto, vanilla bean paste and almond extract.',
				'Next add the butter a few chunks at a time, stirring over the heat until melted evenly.',
				'Then spoon into a bowl, cover with clingfilm (making sure it touches the surface) and leave to cool in the fridge.',
				'When the choux are baked, immediately turn them over and use a knife to pierce the base.',
				'When the creme mousseline is completely cool, whisk again just to loosen it a bit.',
				'Then add the extra softened butter in, a few chunks at a time.',
				'Whisk well until completely smooth.',
				'Pipe the creme mousseline into the cooled choux buns through the hole created earlier, making sure each one is filled completely.',
				'Next, make the icing.',
				'Whisk together the icing sugar and enough water to make an icing that is thick but will still form a smooth coating (you can test this on a spare choux, then adjust the consistency if needed).',
				'Place the choux buns on a wire rack, and then spoon over the icing so that it evenly covers the sides.',
				'Add the panda ears using chocolate buttons.',
				'And then leave to semi set before adding the eyes – you can either use chocolate buttons using a little extra icing to stick them on, or pipe these on.',
				'To pipe on the eyes and mouth, add black food dye to the remaining icing, plus extra icing sugar to achieve a more pipeable consistency.',
				'Then transfer to a piping bag, cut the tip and pipe the details.',

				'I soak the sponge in orange-flavoured alcohol (I loathe the acrid dustiness of standard-issue sherry), infuse the custard with orange, and make an orange caramel to sprinkle over the top; this seems to bring out the fruity, egginess of it all, even if you are reduced to using frozen fruit.',
				'So use the quantities below – which will fill a bowl of about 1½ litre capacity – as a guide only.',
				'Pour the single cream into a wide, heavy-based saucepan, add the orange zest – reserving the juice, separately, for the moment – and bring to the boil without actually letting it boil.',
				'Take off the heat and set aside for the orange flavour to infuse while you get on with the bottom layer of the trifle.',
				'Mix together the Grand Marnier, marsala and the reserved orange juice and pour about half of it into a shallow soup bowl, keeping the rest for replenishing halfway through.',
				'If you’re using the trifle sponges, split them horizontally; if the challah or brioche slices, take the crusts off and cut them each into two equal slices.',
				'Make little sandwiches with the jam, and dunk each sandwich, first one side, then the other, into the booze in the bowl and then arrange the alcohol-sodden sandwiches at the bottom of the trifle bowl.',
				'If you’re using the challah or brioche, you might need to make up more of your alcoholic mixture, as the bread seems to soak it all in much more quickly and thirstily.',
				'When the bottom of the bowl’s covered, top with the fruit and put in the fridge to settle while you get on with the custard.',
				'Bring the orange-zested cream back to the boil, while you whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl large enough to take the cream, too, in a moment.',
				'When the yolks and sugar are thick and frothy, pour the about-to-bubble cream into them, whisking as you do so.',
				'Wash out the pan, dry it well and return the custard mixture, making sure you disentangle every whisk-attached string of orange zest; you will be sieving later, but for now you want to hold on to all of it.',
				'Fill the sink with enough cold water to come about halfway up the custard pan.',
				'On medium to low heat cook the custard, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon or spatula.',
				'If it looks as if it might be about to boil or split, quickly plunge the pan into the sink of cold water, beating furiously until danger is averted.',
				'When it’s cooked and thickened, take the pan over to the sink of cold water and beat robustly but calmly for a minute or so.',
				'When the custard’s smooth and cooled, strain it over the fruit-topped sponge and put the bowl back in the fridge for 24 hours.',
				'Not long before you want to eat it, whip the double cream till thick and, preferably with one of those bendy rubber spatulas, smear it thickly over the top of the custard.',
				'Put it back in the fridge.',
				'Toast the flaked almonds by tossing them in a hot, dry frying pan for a couple of minutes and then remove to a plate till cool.',
				'Squeeze the orange, pour it into a measuring jug and then measure out an equal quantity – gram for millilitre – of sugar; I reckon on getting 100ml of juice out of the average orange.',
				'Pour the orange juice into a saucepan and stir in the sugar to help it dissolve.',
				'Remove from heat, and when cooled slightly, dribble over the whipped cream; you may find this easier to do teaspoon by slow-drizzling teaspoon.',
				'Scatter the toasted almonds over before serving.',

				'The skin is easily removed: roast lightly in a moderate oven, tip into a waiting towel and rub vigorously, as if they had just been plucked from the North Sea.',
				'Peel of 1 lemon in strips, as for a martini.',
				' First, prepare the poaching syrup.',
				'Put all the syrup ingredients into a heavy-bottomed pan.',
				'Put this on a high heat and bring to a boil.',
				'Reduce the heat, simmering for just 1 minute, then keep warm until needed.',
				' Peel the pears.',
				'Add the juice of 2 lemons to a bowl.',
				'Roll each peeled pear in the lemon juice to prevent any unseemly discolouring.',
				'Once all are done, put each pear and any lemon juice still in the bowl into the syrup.',
				'Return the pot to the boil, then lower the heat until the pan is simmering.',
				'Cut a generous disc of silicone paper to lay upon the pears ensuring that none bob upon the surface, cooking unevenly.',
				'A plate over the paper might help, keeping a beady eye that it does not slip beneath the surface.',
				'They will certainly take at least 40 minutes on a gentle simmer, requiring a check every few minutes thereafter.',
				'The final check is made by inserting a sharp knife – should the flesh yield, the pears are cooked.',
				'Once cooked, let the pears cool, remaining covered in the syrup.',
				'Once cooled, remove the plate, but keep the silicone paper atop.',
				' Meanwhile, make the frangipane.',
				'First, grind (or chop) the 200g of hazelnuts quite coarsely, then put them to one side in a bowl.',
				' Beat the softened butter with the sugar, preferably using a kitchen mixer, until thoroughly combined and beginning to turn pale.',
				'Crack the eggs into a cup and beat well with a fork.',
				'Reduce the speed of the mixer, then add the egg to the bowl in a slow and careful stream.',
				'Once thoroughly combined, add the chopped hazelnuts and vanilla seeds reserved from making the syrup.',
				'Stir this well, then transfer the mixture into another bowl, cover and refrigerate.',
				' Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.',
				'Remove the pears from the syrup.',
				'Cut each pear in half, then remove the core and cut in half again.',
				'Repeat until you have a beautiful heap of quartered pears.',
				' Have ready a baking sheet – the largest your oven can accommodate.',
				'Lightly dust a cool work surface with flour.',
				'Begin rolling out the pastry, bearing in mind the shape and size of your baking sheet.',
				'During the final few rolls, strew the pastry with the caster sugar and finish rolling out, crushing the sugar into the pastry.',
				' Transfer the pastry to the baking sheet – the easiest way being to roll the pastry on to the rolling pin and then unravel it on to the baking sheet.',
				' Scoop out spoonfuls of the frangipane and dot evenly over the pastry, keeping a good 2cm border at the edges – vital for rising and keeping the frangipane from making a bid for freedom over the edges.',
				'Lay the quarters of pear over the frangipane in a random manner.',
				' Slide the prepared galette on its baking sheet into the oven.',
				'Turn the heat down to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and cook for 20 minutes, or until puffed and golden.',
				'Reduce the heat further to 150C/300F/gas mark 2 and cook for a further 30-35 minutes, or until bronzed.',
				' When the galette has cooled somewhat, warm the fruit jelly with the juice of the remaining lemon.',
				'When melted and smooth, brush this over the galette and strew with the remaining chopped hazelnuts.',
				'Serve warm with the best, thickest jersey cream.',

				'If you can’t get hold of salt cod, it’s simple to make at home: take a 250g piece of boneless loin or steak, place on a layer of sea salt in a plastic container, cover with more salt, then pop on a lid and refrigerate for up to five days (you can add other flavourings, too: fresh herbs, say, or chopped garlic).',

				'If need be, you can cheat with the allioli by mixing crushed garlic into top-notch mayo.',
				'Put the drained cod, potatoes and bay in a pan and cover with milk.',
				'Bring to a boil and simmer for four to five minutes, until the fish flakes easily away from the skin.',
				'Scoop the fish out of the water and set aside to cool; leave the potatoes to simmer for five to seven minutes more, until almost falling apart.',
				'Drain the potatoes, reserving the poaching milk, then mash smooth with a tablespoon or two of the milk.',
				'Fork in the flaked fish, garlic, parsley, paprika and mustard powder, and season to taste.',
				'Meanwhile, put a tablespoon of oil in a pan and add 150ml water.',
				'Bring to a boil, then take off the heat and add the flour, whisking vigorously, until smooth.',
				'Beat in the eggs one at a time, until combined, then stir in the salt cod mixture and cook over a low heat for three to four minutes, stirring constantly, until the mix thickens.',
				'Spread on a large plate or baking tray, and leave to cool.',
				'For the allioli, put the egg yolks, garlic, mustard, lemon and vinegar in a food processor and blitz briefly.',
				'With the motor running, add the oil drip by drip, until the mix starts to come together, then add the oil in a thin, steady stream until you have a glossy, smooth mayonnaise.',
				'Season to taste, adding a touch more lemon, if you think it needs it.',
				'Using two dessertspoons, shape tablespoons of the salt cod mix into quenelles or rounds.',
				'Arrange on a plate or oven tray lined with greaseproof paper, cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for at least an hour, to firm up, or overnight.',
				'To cook the fritters, fill a wok or heavy-bottomed pan with enough sunflower oil to come 5cm up the sides, then heat to 180C (or until a small cube of bread turns golden in 45 seconds).',
				'Gently drop a few fritters into the hot oil – don’t overcrowd the pan – and fry for two to three minutes, until golden and crisp.',
				'Drain on kitchen towel and serve at once; or make them all in advance and keep warm in a low oven or heat up later in a hot oven.',
				'Just before serving, toss the watercress with the vinegar and oil, season and serve with the warm fritters, allioli and lemon wedges.',
